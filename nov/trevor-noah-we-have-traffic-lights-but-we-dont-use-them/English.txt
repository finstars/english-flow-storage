 I come from an African country, and all over Africa, we have traffic lights, but we don't use them.
 It's less of a command and more of a suggestion.
 It's not stop, it's stop (maybe?).
 It's almost like an African traveled the world, and then just brought them back.
 But didn't know what they were for.
 Like, the guy was just like, guys, guys, guys, we need to get traffic lights, ah?
 And we were like, what for?
 It's for the intersection.
 It adds up atmosphere.
