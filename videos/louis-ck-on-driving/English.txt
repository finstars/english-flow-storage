I am the worst person I can be when I'm behind the wheel, which is when I'm at my most dangerous.
When you're driving, that's when you need to be the most compassionate and responsible of any other time in your life, because you are fucking driving a weapon, amongst weapons, and yet it's the worst people get.
One time I was driving and there was a guy ahead of me and, he kind of, I don't know, he sort of drifted into my lane for a second.
And this came out of my mouth, I said, worthless piece of shit.
I mean, what an indictment! What kind of way is that to feel about another human being?
Worthless piece of shit! That's somebody's son!
And things I've said to other people, I was once driving and some guy in a pickup truck did, I don't remember even, and I yelled out my window, I said, hey, fuck you!
Where, outside of a car, is that even, nearly, okay?
If you were in an elevator, and you were like, right next to a person's body, and whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, would you ever turn right to their face, and go, hey, fuck you!
Worthless piece of shit!
No, literally zero people would ever do that. But put a couple of piece of glass and some road between you, and there's nothing you would not say to them.
I hope you die! I said that to a person! I hope you die!
Why? Because you made me go like this, for half a second of my life.
You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine!
So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!
I mean, what am I capable of? I'd like to think that I'm a nice person, but I don't know, man.
