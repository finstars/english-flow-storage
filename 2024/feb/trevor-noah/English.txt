What I do when I travel is I try to speak to people in their accents and see if they can catch me out.
That's one of my favorite games.
Like, I'd walk into a store in Edinburgh, and I'll just be like, "good afternoon, I would like to buy a pair of shoes"
"Where are you from?"
"I'm from Scotland"
"What part?"
"Johannesburg"
When people say they don't like immigrants, most of the time they're not referring to immigrants who look and sound like them.
They're talking about immigrants who speak differently, who look different.
Because an accent comes with a connotation.
You think you know if someone is smarter or more stupid, because of their accent.
And yet the truth is, an accent is not a measure of intelligence.
It's just someone speaking your language with the rules of theirs.
Accents have connotations we cannot deny.
Look at the French, we all believe that the French are romantic. Why?
Because of their accents.
They've got that thing.
Deux... Deux...
I was thinking that maybe we could deou..
How you say....
Afterwards, maybe we could try to....
Oh My god.... he's so sexy...
Accents determine how we see people.
Same thing happens with the Russians.
The Russians, the most feared people on the planet. Why?
Because of how they speak.
I don't care who you are, you cannot deny that when a Russian speaks, you are not comfortable.
As soon as they open their mouth.
"Yeah, go to kill you, break you, destroy your family."
Even if they say nice things, it still sounds menacing, and dangerous.
"Yeah, fluffy rabbits and teddy bears".
"Happy Valentine's day" - It sounds like a threat.
