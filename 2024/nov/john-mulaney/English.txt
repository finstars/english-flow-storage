Being married so nice, I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself.
That's not really a joke, that's just a little sweet thing I like to say.
Because I'd been in relationships where I got cheated on, like long ones.
I don't know if you've ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on,
but it changes your whole world view.
Because like when I was a kid, I used to watch America's most wanted.
You know how kids do.
And I would always think to myself, how could another person kill someone?
How could a human being kill another human being?
And then I got cheated on and I was like, oh, okay.
I'm not going to do it, but I totally get it.
And I don't mean in that way of like no one else can have you.
Like I don't care about that.
It's just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly.
They have a lot of information.
Anyone who's seen my dick and met my parents needs to die.
I can't have them running around.
