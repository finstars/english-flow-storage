I said to married people stuck at home, I want to be like them.
I envy these guys.
Some of you don't even dress yourselves anymore.
You just wear the next clean shirt.
I want that.
Then I'm like, where do you go to find this wife?
You can go to clubs or bars.
I don't like going to night clubs.
Night clubs are filled with single mothers and liars.
There's a lot of single mothers in the club, and overall single mothers are doing a good job.
But the world is crazy, and you need to wait a while...
...before you introduce these guys you date into your kids.
I went out with this single mother two times.
I'm at work, the school called me to come pick up her son.
You can't put my name on the list to come pick up your son.
I only seen this dude two times in the dark at your house.
They wear uniforms now, they got the same little haircut.
I might pick up the wrong kid.
Now this dude is on my backseat weasin'.
I don't need that.
But I'm scared.
I'm not afraid to admit it.
Marriage is a major decision.
How many times in your life do you want to lose half your stuff?
And I'll share with you what scares me the most.
What scares me the most about marriage is the fact that men and women...
...don't even look at marriage at the same weight.
When women talk about marriage, it's a happy occasion.
I'm getting married, I got my ring, I got my colors picked out,
I got four of my fat friends to stand next to me.
There's gonna be a beautiful day.
No, their dress is ugly, mine is pretty.
But it's not the same for the men.
When men talk about marriage with our friends,
It sounds like something you get diagnosed with.
Did you hear what happened to Charles?
No, what?
He's gettin' married.
No!
I just seen him last week.
When did he find out?
She told him yesterday at dinner.
Is there anything that we could do for him?
No, the invitations already went out.
There's nothing we can do.
That's rough.
