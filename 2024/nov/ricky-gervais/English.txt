I wake up these days and I go, oh fuck, I didn't die.
I've got to do all again.
I've usually hung over, headache, liver pains.
I can't walk for the first five minutes,
Because I've got no joints in my knees.
I'm getting fat again now.
Now I was thin till I was about 28, like proper skinny,
Like nine and a half stone.
Then I got a job.
And the next sort of 20 years were what I call my eating years.
And I just got steadily fatter and fatter.
So I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbyness
When I was about 48 years old.
And it was one Christmas, I was at home lying on the floor.
And...
I was saying to Jane, I'm having a heart attack.
And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130.
I felt nauseous.
I had palpitations. I was sweating,
Because I'd eat in 11 sausages.
True story.
I was like one of them snakes.
You know when you see a big...
like, python swallow a pig whole.
And then it's just fucked.
It's just like...
It's like a duffel bag just there.
That was me.
And obviously I wasn't having a heart attack,
But it worried Jane, she said,
You've got to start looking after yourself.
I thought, yeah, you're right.
I thought, yeah, so I started working out.
I started working out every single day.
I didn't give anything up.
I don't eat meat anymore,
But I was having like two and a half thousand calories,
Three thousand calories a day,
Including wine every night.
But I burnt it off the next day,
Just so I could do all that.
I worked out for an hour and a half,
Every day, running weight training.
I had more time in my hands than the average person.
I had a gym built in my house.
I had no excuse.
And I lost about 20 pounds, and it was great.
But now, I still eat and drink too much.
But I physically can't burn off the calories.
I can't do enough because I'm so old and broken and tired.
So I'm going to get steadily fatter and fatter again.
And this time, I am going to die.
