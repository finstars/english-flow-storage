Eventually, I became a good Asian American, and I went to school, to get an economics degree.
Because that was the easiest degree that can still appease my Asian parents.
But then after I graduated, I didn't want to do like, e-con of finance.
So I got one up to my dad, I was like, Dad, I don't want to do any of this.
I want to go try and do stand up.
And he's like, what's a stand up?
You mean like a talk show?
I was like, yeah, sure, talk show. Whatever you want to call it, okay? But I want to go pursue my dreams.
And he was like, no.
Pursue your dreams how you become homeless.
I was like, no, no, dad, dad, things are different now. We're in America, okay?
In America, we're supposed to do what we love.
He was like, no.
Everyone does what they hate for money and use the money to do what they love.
That's that old school Chinese mentality.
