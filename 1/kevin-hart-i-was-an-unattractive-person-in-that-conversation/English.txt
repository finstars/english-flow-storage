I get irritated very fast. Small things make me mad.
This is not a joke.
This is an example, because I want you to understand what I'm saying.
I don't like it when people eat and sweat at the same time.
I don't fucking like it. I don't fucking like it.
Like, somebody's eating, and they're like, whew.
I'll punch you in the fucking face.
If I'm there, I swear to God. I'll punch you in the fucking face. 
Slow down!
Anybody gonna take that food from you? Slow down!
Tell you what I sound like. You're not gonna like it, but I'm gonna tell you anyway.
I recently realized that I don't have any patients for unattractive people.
There. I said it. That's how I feel.
I know you first hear it. It's a blow. It's a blow at first.
I said, you stay with me.
Okay, stay with me until the end.
I feel like they're very needy.
Unattractive people are very needy.
They always want something.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. You know where I can...
No, I don't. No. No. No.
I treat them like fucking cats.
Get your ass outta here. Get outta here.
It's too much.
It's too fucking much.
Let me take where the joke came from. So you don't think I'm a dick.
I was at the bank. I get down at the bank. I'm in my car and I'm about to pull out the parking lot.
You gotta stop at the little parking booth.
You gotta get a guy, you're ticket.
I go to get a guy in my ticket.
He's sliding glass back, sticks his head out, very unattractive man. Whatever.
He sees me, when he saw me, he lost it.
He got excited.
He's like, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Made the ugly ass face, right in my fucking face.
Kevin Hart, at my bank. You gotta be kidding me.
He's like, I'm not letting you out here until you tell me why you chose us.
Why us? Why you bank with us? Why do you choose us as your financial institution?
I can't believe what the fuck I heard.
I said, I don't have time for this shit.
Press the button, let me the fuck out of here.
I don't have time.
He didn't get, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh.
Hey, let me go out here to you until you tell me, why us. Why do you choose us?
Why us? Why do you choose us? Kept saying us.
I told you, I don't have any patience.
I fucking lost it.
I said, I said, stop saying us.
You don't got shit to do at that goddamn bank.
This parking lot ain't got shit to do with that bank.
Hit the button. Let me the fuck out of here.
This is when I got mad.
He looked me, he said, I got all day, Kevin Hart, all day.
I realized he's not playing. He's not gonna let me out.
I gotta answer this fucking question.
Okay, fine.
You wanna know why I chose this bank? Your customer service, loan rates, free checking.
There you go. That's why. That's why I chose y'all.
This is what pissed me off.
He goes, that's all you got to say. Whatch your little ugly ass.
I said, what did you just said?
What the fuck did you just say to me?
Get your ugly ass out of my life.
He hit the button.
I have to pull off.
Ah! Now, pissed.
I'm not ugly. You ugly.
Fucking pissed.
I stopped at Chipotle two blocks up.
There's a long line at Chipotle. Now I'm even more irritated.
I'm only in this long ass line because of that unattractive ass conversation.
When I'm standing in line, the woman behind me goes, oh my god, such a nice day.
It's so beautiful outside.
I'm about to fucking snap.
I'm gonna lose it.
I'm gonna fucking snap.
I'm gonna turn around. I'm gonna let this goddam woman have it.
I turn around. I see her.
This is by far one of the most attractive women I've ever seen in my fucking life.
She was gorgeous.
Immediately instantly. I had time. I had fucking time.
I said, I said, you know what?
It is nice. It's so nice outside.
I turned it to a fucking weather man.
I said, well, what we need is rain.
We had no rain.
She said, I wasn't even talking to you. Turned her back on me.
What the fuck?
Oh, no, no. That is not acceptable.
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
She turned around.
What?
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
I just want...
I just wanted to know what made you choose this place for lunch today.
I said, ah, ah, ah, ah!
I was an unattractive person in that conversation.
God flipped it on me that fast.
No matter how good you think you look, I promise you that you don't look that fucking good.
My wife gave me a reality check.
We was in a band watching TV.
Commercial came on, with the little monster for Lord of the Rings.
Smegel, I think that's his name.
Smegel, he was doing this shit right here.
You know, little monster? 
My wife said, oh my God, babe, you be going that.
I said, bitch, what did you just say to me?
The fuck did you just say?
You be going that in the morning.
Bitch, I ain't never been on show like that.
I ain't never been on show like that. I ain't never been on show like that.
Called me a fucking monster to my goddamn face.
