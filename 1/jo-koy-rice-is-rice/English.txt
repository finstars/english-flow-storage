I'm half white, half Filipino.
Which means my dad was in the military.
That's already been a joke.
A lot of soldiers were fighting for this country.
My dad was dating.
I'm his purple heart.
My dad would say,
Borderline racist shit to me when I was a kid.
Borderline racist shit.
But I knew he was joking. It's my dad.
Just sitting at the dinner table,
Like, you know why I married your mom, right?
Why?
Because I love Chinese food.
She's Filipino, dad.
Whatever.
Rice is rice.
What the fuck?
Rice is rice!
That's so racist!
