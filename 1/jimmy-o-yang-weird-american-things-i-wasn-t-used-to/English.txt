All these weird American things I wasn't used to.
Eventually I learned how to speak English, by watching a lot of TV.
Mainly, BET Rap City.
Because that was my shit.
I wanted to be cool and nothing cooler than BET rap city, right?
Every music video was a slice of somebody's American dream.
The first music video I saw was Jay-Z Big Pimpin'
You guys remember that shit? Jay-Z's Big Pimpin' was the greatest music video of all time.
It's Jay-Z, and his boys on a yacht, pouring champagne on this beautiful woman's face, for like four minutes.
I was like, this is America?
It's amazing.
That's all I wanted to do.
Like, before I even wanted to get into the stand-up.
That's all I want to do. I want to be a rapper.
I want to be like Jay-Z and Big Pimpin'.
So I started my own rap group, in high school.
It's true story.
It was me, my black friend Julian, and my other friend Yuji, who was half black, and half Japanese.
So we had perfectly one and a half black dudes.
And one and a half asian dudes.
And we called ourselves, the yellow panthers.
I know.
I wish I was making this shit up, but I'm not.
The yellow panthers was a real rap group and we had a real rap song.
It was called, underground railroad builder.
