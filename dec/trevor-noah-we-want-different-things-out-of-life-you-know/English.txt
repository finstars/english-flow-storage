 I went to Bali on vacation, yeah, out in Indonesia, yeah.
 If you've never been, make a plan and get out there. It's an amazing place.
 I went out with some of my friends, learned a few things about myself as a person.
 Most important thing I learned is somebody needs to invent a trip advisor, specifically for black people.
 No, because just generally, I find that what white people want to do on vacation is what black people are trying to escape.
 And not in a bad way.
 It's just like we want different things out of life, you know?
 Like my wife's friends always invite me camping, for instance, always.
 Like with enthusiasm, we're going to be like, Trevor, you want to go camping, dude?
 I'm like, why? Why?
 It's like, dude, what do you mean why? It's amazing. You're kidding me. It's like no water, no electricity, you know?
 It's just like us and the great outdoors, you like, you got to like take a dump in the like in the hole in the floor or something, dude.
 I'm like, yeah, that was my life.
 That was me growing up.
 You know how hot I worked to never go camping again?
 Every day. Every day I wake up in my bed and I'm like, thank God I'm not camping.
 If my family saw pictures of me camping, they would be devastated.
 My grandmother saw me out in the woods. She'd be like, oh, what happened to Trevor?
 Oh, I thought he was successful.
 It must be the crack.
